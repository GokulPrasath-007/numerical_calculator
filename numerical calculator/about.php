<h1>ABOUT </h1>
<h3>Define: Numerology</h3>

<p>Numerology, an ancient practice with roots stretching back thousands of years, is a captivating system that seeks to understand the mystical relationship between numbers and various aspects of life. Across diverse cultures and civilizations, numerology has been revered as a profound tool for gaining insights into personalities, destinies, and the hidden meanings behind numerical sequences.</p>

<p>At its essence, numerology posits that numbers possess symbolic significance and exert influence over our lives. Each number is believed to resonate with its own unique vibrations, energies, and qualities, shaping our experiences and character traits.</p>

<p>Central to numerology is the concept of the "life path number," derived from an individual's birth date. This number serves as a blueprint, offering insights into one's inherent talents, strengths, and challenges. By reducing the digits of the birth date to a single digit or master number, numerologists unveil the core essence of an individual's life journey.</p>
